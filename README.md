# Top Level README WWC - android jan2016

Android study material for WWC-SV Android MeetUp is at WWC's site https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeSV/android.git

## Git Workflow
A single remote repo at WWC's site https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeSV/android.git allows read only access and provides all the labs. Each lab is an Android Studio project.

You can submit pull requests to admin (Trish/Irene/Punam).  You can fork it via Github, but you probably want to clone it so you can pull periodic updates.
