# Top Level README WWC - android jan2016

Android study material for WWC-SV Android MeetUp is at WWC's site https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeSV/android.git

## Git Workflow
A single remote repo at WWC's site https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeSV/android.git allows read only access and provides all the labs. Each lab is an Android Studio project.

You can submit pull requests to admin (Trish/Irene/Punam).  You can fork it via Github, but you probably want to clone it so you can pull periodic updates.  


## Android testing

In 2015 the tool and framework support for Android applications was hugely improved.
Take care that you're not looking at old documenation, for eg, this is old:
 > Note that the Android testing API supports JUnit 3 code style, but not JUnit 4. 
 
Here are some starting points: http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidTesting/article.html
