# Week1: Instructions for Porter’s AsyncTask Lab
Our lab is Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems: Part 2 by Dr. Adam Porter

## Gotchas

Porter's labs are eclipse based. We will be using Android Dev Studio.  Do not use the eclipse-to-studio
tool, rather use instructions below.


The instructions for Porter's lab are in the pdf in toplevel of the lab’s github repo.

Read this, in addition to Porters lecture [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html]
